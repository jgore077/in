That is if I am in a new city and need to get from A to B, GMaps is normally very effective in generating a good route by bus/train/metro/tram.</p><p>Recently though we've been in Toulouse, where this is hardly the case. On multiple occasions GMaps had very limited or no information, and we were able to find much better options elsewhere (asking people around, local websites, etc). <a href=\"https://support.google.com/maps/thread/8182519?hl=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Not only us</a>, it seems. Example: GMaps had literally no options for going from city center to the airport, even though it was very straightforward, few stops by metro and then tram.</p><p>That's fine, one cannot expect to have perfect coverage for such variably-sourced data everywhere. But I am having hard time figuring out how to prepare for that. So the question here is: knowing your destination city ahead of time, how to best figure out if GMaps has sufficient data for the area (and research alternative local apps/maps if it does not)? Or perhaps the whole premise is wrong, and one should never rely on just GMaps?</p>",

        "Body": "<p>I live in France and I was recently traveling to Ireland. During the trip, my debit card stopped functioning. I discovered the problem when I arrived in a hotel and wanted to check in. The card was refused, and the person at the reception invited me to go to an ATM in order to bring some cash, as the hotel accepts only payment by card or cash, and won't accept a bank transfer. But when I tried to get the necessary amount of cash, the ATM plainly rejected the card without even asking for the PIN code. A few other ATMs behaved the same, and the card wouldn't work in a supermarket either.</p><p>I called my bank, but they just confirmed that there is absolutely nothing wrong with my bank account, and nothing is blocked, so the problem was really with my debit card. The only option they suggested is to try a different ATM. It should be noted that this bank doesn't have any subsidiaries in Ireland.</p><p>Thankfully, I wasn't traveling alone, and so I could deal more or less with the difficulty of not being able to get my own money. This made me think, however, of what could have happened if I was alone or if the person I was traveling with wouldn't lend me a rather important amount of money to pay the hotel (as well as food and other expenses).</p><p>So, let's pretend that as a French citizen, I'm alone in either Ireland or the UK, I have no more than twenty Euros in cash, and my debit card stops working (or I lose it or it gets stolen) while I need about six hundred Euros to pay to the hotel <em>right now</em>. What exactly are my options, in a context where I still have a smartphone with Internet access and I can pay by Internet and use PayPal? Is there some way to send oneself some cash or to retrieve it somehow without a debit card?</p>",

Previous interstate was  75mph, we couldn't find any signs but people were going faster than  75mph so we decided to 'go with the flow' and drive about 74/75. After  only minutes on the interstate we got pulled over. The officer came to  the car with his gun drawn (yes, really!) yelling at us not to move.  He wouldn't let us speak, he wouldn't let us move. He asked questions  but didn't let us finish the answers. We made it very clear we were  tourists in a rental car, yet he proceeded to ask us if we were  Californian citizens (the car had a Cali license) multiple times.  After the 3rd time we said we explained where we were from he finally  put the gun away. He told us what we did wrong and when we tried to explain we were tourists and were just trying to do the right thing, he told us to stop talking. He told us to report to court within 15 days and  when we tried to explain we were leaving the country and didn't know what to do and he told us in a  very threatening way we 'better report to court within 15 days or a  warrant would be put out'.</p>    <p>This all happened at election night, I hope the officer was just  having a bad day and this is NOT a normal experience with the law in  the US.
