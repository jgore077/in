When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p><p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>",

        "Body": "<p>In a few weeks, my two kids (6.5 and 4) and I will be in London.  We will need to get from Paddington Station (Heathrow Express terminus) to Euston Station (trains to the North).  I am trying to figure out the safest way to do this.  For the purposes of this question, I am mostly defining \"safe\" as meaning minimizing the amount of time walking along the busy streets with two kids and all our luggage, while in a jet-lagged state.  For example I don't really want to get the Circle line tube to Euston Square then cross over busy Euston Street to get to Euston Station proper.</p><p>My research so far yields the following options:</p><ul><li><p>London taxi.  This seems like a no-brainer, but so far I don't fully understand the carseat situation.  As far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-car-seats-the-rules/when-a-child-can-travel-without-a-car-seat\">it is <em>legal</em></a> for the kids (of this age) to travel using adult seatbelts, if carseats are not provided.  However, in the interests of safety, I don't want to travel in a taxi without carseats of appropriate size for my kids.  I've read that <em>some</em> taxis have carseats, but its not clear how common this is.  </p></li><li><p>Tube.  Unfortunately as far as I can tell, there are no direct tube lines from Paddington to Euston station.  I think I'd have to do Circle line to St. Pancras then Northern line to Euston, or Bakerloo line to Charing Cross then Northern line to Euston.  The extra tube change does not sound particularly appealing.</p></li></ul><p>So my question boils down to the following parts:</p><ol><li><p>Is it reasonable to expect to easily get a taxi with carseats at Paddington Station, without an unreasonable wait?</p></li><li><p>If taxis are not an option, then what's the best tube route from Paddington to Euston, bearing in mind luggage and two kids.</p></li></ol><hr><p>A bit more background:  Our journey is actually from Heathrow to Stoke-on-Trent.  After considering safety, I'm hoping this journey will be as relaxed and stress-free as possible, so I'm hoping for as few changes as possible.  Heathrow Express seems to be the most reasonable train out of Heathrow, and Euston to Stoke on Virgin seems like the best way to get to Stoke.  However if there are other options that I've missed, then I'd love to hear them.</p>",

On the other hand, the problem shouldn't be from my side because I didn't see similar behaviors traveling in neighboring countries (supposedly be similar cultures) e.g. Iran or Georgia and none of the mentioned problems happen within the Turkish university that I want to study in.     </p><p><strong><em>Edit</strong>. In the last two days I learnt some Turkish and I used it. But sadly  I received much worse reactions. Reasons can be more than I know, but the two reasons I believe are that the people don't like to hear different accents (for being a very homogeneous society) and the other is they think I am an asylum seeker that I have to learn their language. Please correct me if I am wrong but I heard from a few other foreign students felt very unwelcome unless they speak English.

        "Body": "<p>I had assumed that buying round-trip plane tickets saves a lot of money, but lately I've been comparing prices and the round-trips I've seen are almost identical in price to just buying two one-way tickets separately.</p><p>If round-trip tickets are just supposed to be more convenient, then that benefit surely seems outweighed by the flexibility that one-way tickets give you. Not only is it easier to choose different airports for your outbound and inbound flights, but you can avoid the usual traps if you want to change something later on. I've been in situations where I've needed to change just the outbound flight and the cheapest option was to just buy a new one-way ticket but I couldn't do that because the rigidity of the round-trip ticket prevented a traveler from boarding a return flight if they didn't board the outbound flight. With a round-trip ticket, the whole thing counts as one. If you want to make one little change to one leg of one flight and you can't do it, the whole ticket is wasted. (In the same vein, it seems you also get less flexibility and almost no benefit from putting multiple passengers on the same ticket.)</p><p>So my question is this. Is convenience and a marginal (perhaps even only perceived) cost difference the only benefit to a round-trip ticket? Or is there some other purpose I'm not aware of?</p><p>EDIT Nov 3: I apologize for not considering international travel. It's been many years since I've flown outside of the US.</p>",

        "Body": "<p>When staying in hostel dorms I usually place my valuables in a locker provided by the hostel and lock it, typically with my own key-padlock. When I go out I take the key with me and I'm perfectly fine with that. </p><p>However <strong>when I am sleeping at night, what is the best practice to storing the key to my locker/padlock?</strong> (While I am asking about the key only, I typically also have my cell-phone out to charge at night and as it serves me as an alarm clock in the morning, so a ideally a solution would be valid also for that.)<br>I am a deep sleeper at times and I am concerned someone might take the key from me, open the locker and make off with my valuables while I'm snoring away in a worst case scenario.</p><ul><li>I mean I could wear boxers with a sewn-in secret pocket for my key, but I don't have that and it might still end up uncomfortable.  </li><li>I guess many would place their key (and stuff) under their pillow but I typically move around and don't necessarily sleep with my head on the pillow so that would not work for me either.  </li><li>What I typically currently do is to leave my key (and cell) in the pockets of my pants, roll them up into a packet when I go to sleep and place them on the wall side of my bed, near to my head. I've never had any problems with that, but I guess that is more due to luck than fool-proofness of my method. </li><li>Finally I know there are combination padlocks out there but they can be opened by trial and error <a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/76073/32134\">or easier</a> and have <a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/76053/32134\">other deficits</a>. </li></ul><p>So ideally I am looking for something that outperforms the above practices in the given scenario, but I am of course all in for other useful hints. </p>",
