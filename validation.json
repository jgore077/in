When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p><p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>",

        "Body": "<p>In a few weeks, my two kids (6.5 and 4) and I will be in London.  We will need to get from Paddington Station (Heathrow Express terminus) to Euston Station (trains to the North).  I am trying to figure out the safest way to do this.  For the purposes of this question, I am mostly defining \"safe\" as meaning minimizing the amount of time walking along the busy streets with two kids and all our luggage, while in a jet-lagged state.  For example I don't really want to get the Circle line tube to Euston Square then cross over busy Euston Street to get to Euston Station proper.</p><p>My research so far yields the following options:</p><ul><li><p>London taxi.  This seems like a no-brainer, but so far I don't fully understand the carseat situation.  As far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-car-seats-the-rules/when-a-child-can-travel-without-a-car-seat\">it is <em>legal</em></a> for the kids (of this age) to travel using adult seatbelts, if carseats are not provided.  However, in the interests of safety, I don't want to travel in a taxi without carseats of appropriate size for my kids.  I've read that <em>some</em> taxis have carseats, but its not clear how common this is.  </p></li><li><p>Tube.  Unfortunately as far as I can tell, there are no direct tube lines from Paddington to Euston station.  I think I'd have to do Circle line to St. Pancras then Northern line to Euston, or Bakerloo line to Charing Cross then Northern line to Euston.  The extra tube change does not sound particularly appealing.</p></li></ul><p>So my question boils down to the following parts:</p><ol><li><p>Is it reasonable to expect to easily get a taxi with carseats at Paddington Station, without an unreasonable wait?</p></li><li><p>If taxis are not an option, then what's the best tube route from Paddington to Euston, bearing in mind luggage and two kids.</p></li></ol><hr><p>A bit more background:  Our journey is actually from Heathrow to Stoke-on-Trent.  After considering safety, I'm hoping this journey will be as relaxed and stress-free as possible, so I'm hoping for as few changes as possible.  Heathrow Express seems to be the most reasonable train out of Heathrow, and Euston to Stoke on Virgin seems like the best way to get to Stoke.  However if there are other options that I've missed, then I'd love to hear them.</p>",

In the last two days I learnt some Turkish and I used it. But sadly  I received much worse reactions. Reasons can be more than I know, but the two reasons I believe are that the people don't like to hear different accents (for being a very homogeneous society) and the other is they think I am an asylum seeker that I have to learn their language.

Not only is it easier to choose different airports for your outbound and inbound flights, but you can avoid the usual traps if you want to change something later on. I've been in situations where I've needed to change just the outbound flight and the cheapest option was to just buy a new one-way ticket but I couldn't do that because the rigidity of the round-trip ticket prevented a traveler from boarding a return flight if they didn't board the outbound flight. With a round-trip ticket, the whole thing counts as one. If you want to make one little change to one leg of one flight and you can't do it, the whole ticket is wasted. (In the same vein, it seems you also get less flexibility and almost no benefit from putting multiple passengers on the same ticket.)</p><p>So my question is this. Is convenience and a marginal (perhaps even only perceived) cost difference the only benefit to a round-trip ticket? Or is there some other purpose I'm not aware of?</p><p>EDIT Nov 3: I apologize for not considering international travel. It's been many years since I've flown outside of the US.</p>",

In my daily life I do this by avoiding anything wrapped in plastic - if it's absolutely unavoidable, I try to find a way to reuse it.</p><p>On a flight however, it seems like my options are very limited. I've thought about bringing my own cutlery, but I'm concerned the single-use cutlery provided will just get thrown out anyway. There's also the plastic coverings, which are probably recyclable, but I can't recall seeing them being separated from the general rubbish. There's probably things I haven't thought of as well.</p><p>What are some things I can do minimise the waste I am responsible for given that I'm on a flight? I also want to support organisations that are taking waste minimisation seriously. Are there airlines that are taking a pro-active approach to waste minimisation?</p><p>Edit: Thank you everyone for the answers. The general trend is order-of-magnitude arguments essentially saying if you take the flight, any other concern is insignificant. I want to make a few comments:</p><p>Firstly, no one has provided any data quantifying the environmental impact of 1kg CO2 emissions to (say) 1kg of single-use plastic that goes to landfill. Without this data then the arguments are heuristic at best (although I don't doubt which way the conclusion will fall).</p><p>Secondly, CO2 off sets are a thing, and if the companies providing them are to be believed, then your global warming contribution is negated. If that is the case, then the next thing to work on is the waste you generate. </p>",

In the event that a passenger  incurs such costs, in the event of a delay or cancellation, we will  reimburse within reasonable limits if such costs were deemed necessary  and specified receipt can be presented. We cannot reimburse these  costs if the passenger does not allow us to offer this kind of  assistance or if the costs arose as a result of lost connection with  Norweigan, in a separate booking number, or if the alternative  departures offered to the passenger , was not appropriate. The  Norwegian ticket will only be refunded if the flight is canceled or  the delay is over 5 hours and the passenger chooses not to travel. If  the passenger is entitled to reimbursement of the new ticket (with  Norwegian or with another company), we will only reimburse the cost of  the new ticket or the price difference between the new ticket and the  ticket with Norwegian if the Norwegian ticket is refunded.</p>    <p>Additional costs not directly linked to the service regulated by EU  Regulation 261/2004 will only be reimbursed <strong>if the reason for the</strong>  <strong>delay or cancellation is within our control</strong>. If we believe that the  passenger has not done enough to ensure that the pre-booked  arrangements can be completed (eg relocations, accommodation, events,  etc.), we will not be able to cover these costs even if the delay or  cancellation is within our control . Likewise, we cannot cover  consequential non-documented damages, expenses that would have arisen  independently of the irregularity, or unnecessary legal assistance to  determine such claims. Under the Montreal Convention and the decision  of the Norwegian Aviation Complaints Board in case number 1222 / 14F,  the same conditions apply to reimbursement of consequential damages,  provided that the airline has made every effort to avoid the technical  problems that caused the delay or cancellation of the flight. Under  Article 12 of the EU Regulation 261/2004, additional costs that are  not directly related to the service regulated by the regulation may be  deducted from standard compensation.

This cost me no legal fees at all. Thanks for the help!</p>",

        "Body": "<p>This morning I had to make a small (2-3 hours) train journey with a friend. He is a little anxious and unreasonable, and doesn't trust public transport. He won't fly at all and normally, he doesn't take the train, because he says it is too dangerous. Normally, he only trusts himself when he is the driver of his car. But today it was necessary to take the train.</p><p>During the journey, we had a discussion about the safest place in a train. I'm convinced that the safest places are in the back of the train, since normally, if a train has an accident, it either hits something head-on or the engine derails. So I assume that the impact is lower in the back of the train.</p><p>My friend argues that the places at the front of the train are safer. He has various reasons for that: </p><ol><li>In case of emergency it is more probable that the electronic is working in front of the train. Therefore it is easier to open doors and get out of the train. He compares that with seats on a place directly around a emergency exit. </li><li>The driver of a vehicle always protects his side unconsciously. I can follow this argument in case of a car, but how should it work in a train? </li><li>Cars at the end of a train have a higher chance to derail.</li></ol><p>So I'm not sure who is right. Are there any statistics about safest places in a train? I know that such things exists for planes, but how is it in trains? I would really like to persuade my friend, so that we can travel more together by train.</p>",

My initial assumption was based on my previous experience, in which I was eating at a restaurant in Paris (I can't recall it's name, but it was quite popular (but not expensive)). When I asked the waitress for tap water as my drink (and declined wine and other drink options), she was visibly shocked and upset. For the rest of the evening she either ignored me (and my wife), or if she had to interact with us, she had a permanent scowl directed at us.

When I go out I take the key with me and I'm perfectly fine with that. </p><p>However <strong>when I am sleeping at night, what is the best practice to storing the key to my locker/padlock?</strong> (While I am asking about the key only, I typically also have my cell-phone out to charge at night and as it serves me as an alarm clock in the morning, so a ideally a solution would be valid also for that.)<br>I am a deep sleeper at times and I am concerned someone might take the key from me, open the locker and make off with my valuables while I'm snoring away in a worst case scenario.</p><ul><li>I mean I could wear boxers with a sewn-in secret pocket for my key, but I don't have that and it might still end up uncomfortable.  </li><li>I guess many would place their key (and stuff) under their pillow but I typically move around and don't necessarily sleep with my head on the pillow so that would not work for me either.  </li><li>What I typically currently do is to leave my key (and cell) in the pockets of my pants, roll them up into a packet when I go to sleep and place them on the wall side of my bed, near to my head. I've never had any problems with that, but I guess that is more due to luck than fool-proofness of my method. </li><li>Finally I know there are combination padlocks out there but they can be opened by trial and error <a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/76073/32134\">or easier</a> and have <a href=\"https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/76053/32134\">other deficits</a>. </li></ul><p>So ideally I am looking for something that outperforms the above practices in the given scenario, but I am of course all in for other useful hints. </p>",
